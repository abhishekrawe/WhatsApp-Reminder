### 🔔Setting up reminders

- Simple click on `Reminder notes Here......` and Add your Reminder that you want to remind .
- The general format is `set <Reminder-name (Not required)> <task-time (required)> <task-date (it take Present date if not given)>`.
  - `task-name`: **Not required field**. Type the task that you want to be reminded about in .
  - `task-date`: **An optional field**. The default value is current date however you can also type here `today` if you want to put some extra efforts. For dates other than current date, type in **DD/MM/YY** format.
  - `task-time`: **A required field**. Type the time you want to be reminded at in **12 HOUR** format `AM or PM `.
- Examples :
  - Set a reminder for Conducting Session at 5:23 PM today --> `Session on ReactJS` `2/15/2022 5:23 AM `
  - Set a reminder for Todays for Going to Gym at 7:00 PM --> `Go to Gym` `2/15/2022(No Need to give the Date- It take by Default for Today ) 5:23 AM `

### 😪Keep in mind

Just like me, this bot is lazy 🦥 and needs to sleep 😴 0000 to 0600 (IST) everyday (due to Heroku's policies). So try **NOT** to set any reminders for the above timings. Also Twilio's WhatsApp API is in beta which may cause issues or even stop working all together. **Also this project is eventually destined to be sun-setted after the trial balance of Twilio is over**.
